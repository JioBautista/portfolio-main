                Drinking Game App

              <p>
                Introducing a new drinking game app designed to spark laughter
                and a bit of playful suspicion. The core mechanic is simple yet
                engaging: at the start of each round, every player receives a
                randomly assigned flag, visible only to them â€“ it's either red
                or green. The goal is to deduce which of your friends is the
                "red flag," leading to hilarious accusations and, of course,
                drinks! This app will be developed using React for a dynamic
                front-end, styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive
                design. The backend will be powered by Express.js, with
                WebSockets integrated to ensure seamless real-time updates and a
                truly interactive gaming experience.
